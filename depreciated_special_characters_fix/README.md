# GE dicom fix special characters.m

This is an old matlab script to fix special characters. 

Special characters = errors in dicom tags when a GE ASTM encounters e.g. a German umlaut in the dicom tag. Replaces with "Error!"

This script has been updated to a more general python version. See **GETK** option *FSC*.
